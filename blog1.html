      <p class="para1">Python is consistently featured amongst the top most loved languages in our Developer Survey. In 2020, 66.7% of respondents said they want to keep working with Python. Conceived in the late 80s, it’s one of the older languages on our list, coming just below newcomers Rust (2010) and TypeScript (2012)—evidence that original designer Guido van Rossum got a lot right.</p>
      <p class="para2">Python’s quirky name—in honor of the cult comedy show, Monty Python—belies the fact that this is a hugely expressive language. While it’s not primarily used for performance-intensive programming, it’s often highly efficient to write, and programs tend to be clear and readable. This makes it ideally suited for applications like data science and web development, and it’s used in a wide range of fields, from healthcare and finance to VFX and AI.</p>
      <p class="para3">Some  regard it as an ideal language for beginners: many terms are expressed using English words rather than symbols, its strict rules about whitespace mean all programs are visually consistent, and code written in Python is often more concise than the equivalent in other languages.</p>
      <p class="para4">lthough Python has been around since the 1.0 release in 1991, its usage has ballooned in recent years. Indeed, as our former data scientist David Robinson noted, since 2012, it has risen above the five other major languages (C++, PHP, Java, JavaScript and C#) in usage as estimated by the number of Stack Overflow question views per month. TIOBE’s 2021 index ranks Python as third in popularity at 10.86%, rapidly gaining on C and Java (16.34% and 11.29% respectively). Today, 44 % of developers and technologists around the world are using Python. </p>
      <p class="para5">Until recently the language design and development was lead by a single person—Dutch computer scientist Guido van Rossum, who stepped down as Python’s “Benevolent Dictator For Life” in 2018 but has remained an active contributor to this day.</p>
