      <h1 class="head3">Daily life of engineering student at Amity university </h1>
      <hr>
      <p class="para1">As you all know that I am first year student in Amity University, Noida and due to covid there are no offline classes and My first 3 months of college
        is ruined because of this. My last year of school is also gone like this all year sitting in home taking online classes and just got 1 month to
        go to school but because of covid restriction there was no fun at all.</p>
      <p class="para2">I am taking my online classes for time being but there is hope that next month on 15th of november my college will reopen for offline
          classes and praying so that 3rd wave of covid will stop so that our colleges goes offline</p>
      <p class="para3">Here I am going to write about "daily life of an amity student"</p>

      <h2 class="heada">15 november</h2>
      <p class="para6">Today was my first day at Amity university. I enter in the university and it was so good and there are many students around the campus
        of different department and there are numbers of blocks in Amity university. Our block was E-block and it was huge and its like a giant
        maze. The Architects who so ever made that building was total drunk. I can't find my classroom for like 30 minutes and I was roming in the
        building in search of classroom then after some guidance I got my classroom and there were lots of students of my batch and they are really good
        and some are wierd but it was ok. At 13:15 my first class begin and our teacher is so cool and good. At first day explain some stuffs
        and after some time he gave us free period and then we started our studies like some example.
         </p>
      <p class="para6">At 14:15 our maths class start and to be honest it our maths teacher is so boring and its damn hard to understand at that point
       and we didn't study good at online classes. Then there was 1hr break and then was class of C class  and it is bit harder than Python
       and our teacher is so boring and she speakes so low and in very low intensity. The after that there was our practical
       of machanics and it was intersting and interactive. If I sumup all this, faculty of Amity university is very good
       and our campus is very beautiful and students are so cool.</p>
     <h2 class="headb">16 November</h2>
     <p class="para6">Today my day was good and it was bit hectict and at 12:00 I arrived in university 1hr early than the class and first we go for our ID cards
     department and then we sit in the class and have some fun then at 13:15 our physics class started and our is good but he is bit boring
     plus he gave us for idea or adivce to study physics and maths properly because majorly students got fail in these exams because students
     don't pay enough attention to classes or to these subjects and if you get a back in 1 subject then your whole is spoiled and even
     your whole engineering carrer as companies see these marks and see record of your back exam and there are 80% chances that companies
     don't select you for job, so study hard and make sure that you don't get back in any subject. After that there was class of communication
     and teacher is very interactive with students and I was feeling bit sleepy in that class because the topic was so boring. And then Our
     maths teacher cancel our break period and I think mathematics teacher are trained to eat students free time for resting
     or for fun, its like a universal thing for all maths teache.</p>
     <p class="para6">and then there was class of physics lab and it was very intersting and fun as we don't attend any online class for lab seriously And
     in class our group was searching for youtube videos to study how to start an experiment because our teacher is bit strict in that case
     because he thought that we had taken our online classes seriously but that not true at all we all were like reading procedure from file
     and doing that experiment step by steps but its was fun and good. our classes end up pretty early than its time so we went to cantine and
     some food and talk to our friends about them and we got lot to know about them. I am going to say that todays was all fun and good.
     </p>
     <p class="para6">Lets see how tomorrow will go and accourding to our time table I think its going to be good.</p>
